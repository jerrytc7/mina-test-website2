Students whose science reading and comprehension is at a high level are provided the opportunity to enrich their learning and to move on to a more advanced level of content. In addition to the text book, instruction takes place through several means use physical models, experiments, and educational videos which are incorporated into the curriculum. This provides students the opportunity to learn the material in a variety of ways and improves long-term comprehension.",

        "description": "Formal science instruction begins with life science. Students learn about plants and animals, classification systems, plant reproduction, adaptations, and characteristics. One of the most significant aspects of instruction at this level is that students become familiar with the study skills needed to understand more complex science topics. This in turn leads to an increase in student interest in science and a better overall grasp of the subject."

        "description": "Students who read with confidence take Introduction to Chemistry. Physical models are utilized to enhance studentâ€™s learning. As with other academic subjects, it is imperative students not only read but also comprehend the subject matter. Our teachers ensure students always explain technical concepts using proper scientific vocabulary. At this level we also begin teaching students to write about what they have learned using the scientific method. After chemistry, physics is introduced and then biology."
