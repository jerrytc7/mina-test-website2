Mina's hands-on-method of instruction not only provides student's with a visual representation of what they are learning, but also allows them to conceptually understand the material, rather than memorizing.  Whether your child is struggling or wants to stay ahead of the class, our tutoring program can accommodate any student's needs. We specialize on working with younger children, but are open to help any students looking to better themselves.",

After polishing up the basics and making sure there is a solid foundational understanding of phonics, our students have shown a tremendous ability to spell and pronounce larger, more complex words after only a short time. Not only does their ability grow, but by focusing on understanding the roots of the English language, our program also gives students the fundamentals to succeed in the future when encountering words they have never seen before! We work on all aspects of Phonics with our program's students, including pronunciation, spelling, and hand-writing.",
