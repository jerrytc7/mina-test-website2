          The camps are an excellent way for your children to prepare their math
          skills (basic through algebra/geometry) for the coming school year.
          Furthermore, they can improve their phonics skills. The camps are
          focused academic sessions where genuine learning takes place under the
          direction of Ms. Mina Kondner, the principal and director of Mina's
          School of Great Falls. The lessons are designed in a step-by-step
          process to ensure your child has a strong foundation in both math and
          phonics.
