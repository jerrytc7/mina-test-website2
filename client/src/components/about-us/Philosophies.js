        <p>
          Our experience suggests that exposing children to a small group
          environment in school improves the student’s self-esteem, social
          development, and confidence. There are many positive benefits that
          come from a setting that helps children form deep friendships while
          also requiring the child to learn problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        <h4>Healthy Relationships Among Students</h4>
        <p>
          In a small school bullying and other negative behaviors are dealt with
          promptly and constructively. Children develop conflict resolution
          skills which help them form healthy personal relationships throughout
          their lives.
        </p>
        <h4>Real-World Problem-Solving Skills</h4>
        <p>
          Small-setting classes more closely resemble a real-world environment
          in which small teams of individuals work closely together and,
          therefore, must resolve issues with their peers. Many social skills,
          such as small group collaboration, are acquired and practiced through
          interactions in the school. Also, a small-group setting resembles a
          family environment.
        </p>
        <h4>Better Self-Esteem</h4>
        <p>
          Unlike a small school environment, large settings expose children to
          social cliques and heavy peer pressure as the child often is
          encouraged by other students to stand out individually and test
          authority to gain acceptance.
        </p>
        <h4>Emphasis on Basics</h4>
        <p>
          Emphasis is on basics which increase the attention of the children. We
          practice this method consistently and successfully in each class.
        </p>

      <h3>Teaching Methodologies</h3>
      <p>
        We place our students in an appropriate level of educational instruction
        for their skill level in each subject, rather than simply an aged-based
        grade level. We conduct a detailed evaluation of every student to ensure
        the child is taught the material he/she can handle while also challenged
        to move up to the next level of difficulty.
      </p>
      <h4>Study Skills</h4>
      <p>
        After learning basic reading skills students learn how to study material
        effectively. Ms. Mina’s method enables our students to study
        independently. Our students acquire a strong work ethic and a solid
        working knowledge of the subject matter.
      </p>
      <h4>No Skipped Steps</h4>
      <p>
        Each child must master the topic of the lesson before moving ahead to
        ensure a high level of performance in all subjects. This is a key to our
        success.
      </p>
      <h4>Smooth Progression</h4>
      <p>
        Many of our students at the 6th grade level are working on high school
        geometry, without pressure from parents or the school. We also have
        accepted children who are behind their grade level. By developing an
        individualized curriculum for their studies we help them quickly and
        smoothly advance in their program.
      </p>
      <h4>Proven Results</h4>
      <p>
        Providing a solid foundation for Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry,
        grammar, social studies, and science helps your child achieve
        astonishing results. Students remain enthusiastically engaged in their
        work, develop good self-esteem and confidence and are prepared to take
        on high school classes with a positive attitude and intellectual
        curiosity.
      </p>
      <h4>Parent Involvement</h4>
      <p>
        We encourage parents to support their children’s reading for pleasure at
        home. The school also works closely with each parent to ensure the
        child’s success.
      </p>
      <h3>ADHD</h3>
      <p>
        We agree with Dr. Jerome Kagan, a Harvard University professor, who
        rejects the notion that a large percentage of children suffer from ADHD.
        Many years of experience in teaching indicates the real problem is that
        the majority of our children suffer from Teaching Deficit Disorder
        (TDD). In our school, we have been able to take every child who has
        walked through our doors and successfully teach them math, grammar,
        writing, social studies, and science.​ Our success in teaching every
        child in our school proves that the solution to learning is heavily
        dependent on the teaching method and skills of the teacher, rather than
        solely on the learning ability of the student.
