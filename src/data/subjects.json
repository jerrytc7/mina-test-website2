We assess new students to determine if any fundamental reviewing must occur, and quickly get to work addressing any weaker areas the student may have. Miss Mina’s hands-on method of teaching allows students of any level to easily visualize topics and gives them a solid understanding, without any memorization. Click any of the subjects below for a more detailed explanation of our teaching methods.",

      {
        "title": "Addition",
        "description": "In the addition lessons, the students use manipulatives such as ten blocks and place value mats. We make sure every student knows each lesson before the child moves on to the next step of addition. We begin by teaching numbers (reading and making numbers). By the end of the addition package, students will have learned to add three-digit numbers to three-digit numbers mentally and to add larger numbers on paper."
      },
      {
        "title": "Subtraction",
        "description": "In subtraction, we use same manipulatives as in the addition package along with real-world money. Students learn simple subtraction and end up mentally able to subtract numbers in the thousands. They also learn about monetary units and to use their mental math knowledge to handle currency problems. Students also learn how to subtract on paper and to regroup numbers. Finally, they are given a variety of word problems that include addition and subtraction."
      },
      {
        "title": "Simple Multiplication/Division",
        "description": "For multiplication, students use manipulatives which are called the “spider and caterpillar.” The spider and caterpillar legs are filled with identical groups of beads and then used as a visual aid or hands on multiplication table. Coins and cubes, or counters, provide another way for our students to visually understand multiplication and division."
      },
      {
        "title": "Advanced Multiplication",
        "description": "The advanced multiplication package teaches students rounding and how to multiply two-digit numbers times a one-digit number mentally. Students complete this topic with the know how to multiply three-digit by two-digit numbers on paper."
      },
      {
        "title": "Long Division",
        "description": "The long division package starts with the reinforcement of simple division to connect it with the estimation of division. With the estimation skill, many students can easily do long division without any guessing. The long division lesson starts with small long division problems and moves to larger numbers. By the end of the package, students learn about divisibility and practice related word problems. These word problems are made easy through a method called “group, in the group, total.” Using this process, students can perform multiplication, division, times as much, and any other word problems that typically are harder due to the wording and numbers."
      },
      {
        "title": "Fractions",
        "description": "During the fraction lessons, students use fraction bars to envision and understand each lesson within the packages. Fractions are divided into five packages: introduction, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each package prepares the child for the next lesson."
      },
      {
        "title": "Introduction to Fractions",
        "description": "In this package, students learn all there is to know about simple and more complex fractions. Topics included in the beginning level incorporates work that prepares students for the next level, and includes greatest common factor (GCF), Least Common Multiple (LCM), equivalent fractions, comparing fractions and, improper and mixed numbers."
      },
      {
        "title": "Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division of Fractions",
        "description": "Students use the skills gained in the beginning fraction lessons to add, subtract, multiply, and divide simple fractions and mixed numbers. By the end of this topic students are able to work independently to solve word problems and write down the mathematical process."
      },
      {
        "title": "Decimals",
        "description": "The decimal package uses a manipulative called the “decimal chart.” Students start by gaining a working knowledge of the meaning of decimals. Then they learn how to do mental math with decimals, including adding, subtracting, and multiplying the numbers. Children add, subtract, and apply these skills to multiplication and division of decimals using a simple method. Students also learn to convert fractions to decimals and vice versa. By the end of this topic, students work on decimal word problems."
      },
      {
        "title": "Percent",
        "description": "In the percent lessons, students also will use the decimal chart to understand the connection between decimals and percent. Fraction bars create a visual connection between fractions and percent. This helps students convert decimals and fractions to percent and vice versa. After students properly understand each concept in the percent package, they move on to complete 7th grade level percent lessons. Seventh grade percent work includes ratio, rate, unit rate, and proportion. With that knowledge, students can apply proportions to solve percent word problems. They work on word problems containing percent questions and a mix of other topics from earlier lessons. The percent package is considered the end of an elementary level knowledge of mathematics. At this point the level of many of the questions is similar to that found on the SAT test!"
      },
      {
        "title": "Integers",
        "description": "In our integers package, we use a number line, and blue and red tiles that represent debt and earning (positive and negative). Learning through these manipulatives, students grow to understand completely when they should add or subtract, and when an answer is negative or positive. Students also use their addition and subtraction mental math skills to work with integers. With the knowledge gained from the integers and fraction’s packages, students can easily perform all four operations with negative and positive fractions."
      },
      {
        "title": "Units of Measurement",
        "description": "In the measurement unit, there is an emphasis on the metric system. Students also learn to use the “customary system” for every day measurement. Students practice the lesson using manipulatives that visually demonstrate the different types of units and their meaning. At the end of this package, students are taught about elapsed time. As in other lessons, the measurement topic requires a lot of practice."
      },
      {
        "title": "Geometry",
        "description": "The geometry package starts with a simple understanding of shapes. This package uses a combination of practice problems found in the 6th and 7th grade math book. The lessons are taught from those books and manipulatives are used to reinforce each lesson on shapes, lines, angles, etc. Using “nets,” students take a three-dimensional shape and unfold it to create a two-dimensional space figure which they can work with to find the surface area of a solid. The children develop a deep understanding of the relationship between two- and three-dimensional objects. By the end of this package, the student will learn how to find the perimeter, area, and volume of every shape through a concrete understanding of geometry rather than solely memorizing formulas soon forgotten."
      },
      {
        "title": "Equations",
        "description": "In this package, students learn to combine like terms and by the end to solve for the variable in both simple and complex equations using integers and fractions. They also learn to factor numbers in preparation for algebra."
      },
      {
        "title": "Exponents",
        "description": "The exponents package teaches students about positive and negative exponents, solving equations with exponents, and using scientific notation."
