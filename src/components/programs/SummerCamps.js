          The camps are an excellent way for your children to prepare their math
          skills (basic through algebra/geometry) for the coming school year.
          Furthermore, they can improve their phonics skills. The camps are
          academic camps where genuine learning takes place under the direction
          of Ms. Mina Kondner the principal and director of Mina's School of
          Great Falls. The lessons are designed in a step-by-step process to
          ensure your child has a strong foundation in both math and phonics.
