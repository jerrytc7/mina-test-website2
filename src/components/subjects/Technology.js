          Technology is an important extension of the math and science
          instruction. Children learn the connection between the conceptual
          subjects of math and science and how they become concrete through the
          physical implementations of practical everyday technology. By
          exploring and tinkering with technology, students learn to appreciate
          the necessary foundations provided by math and science.

        <h4>Computer Technology</h4>
        <p>
          Applications (MS Office), programming, and website administration are
          developed and used by children during the course of study.
        </p>
        <h4>Mechanics & Electronics</h4>
        <p>
          Everyday things like motors, engines, electricity, circuits, plumbing,
          etc. are explored so that students understand the scientific
          foundations behind their everyday lives. Contact Ms. Mina for detailed
          explanation of her methods and program!
