          At our school, the most important aspect of education is learning how
          to learn. This means teaching students study skills which they can use
          in science and across the curriculum. Identifying essential facts and
          the most important points to remember within a paragraph form the
          foundation of our method of teaching. We group children according to
          their level of understanding and not their current grade level.
          Students whose science reading and comprehension is at a high level
          are provided the opportunity to enrich their learning and to move on
          to a more advanced level of content. In addition to the text book,
          instruction takes place through several means use physical models,
          experiments, and educational videos which are incorporated into the
          curriculum. This provides students the opportunity to learn the
          material in a variety of ways and improves long-term comprehension.

          We introduce the Pearson Education Interactive Science textbook to
          students once they reach a minimum critical reading level.

          Formal science instruction begins with life science. Students learn
          about plants and animals, classification systems, plant reproduction,
          adaptations, and characteristics. One of the most significant aspects
          of instruction at this level is that students become familiar with the
          study skills needed to understand more complex science topics. This in
          turn leads to an increase in student interest in science and a better
          overall grasp of the subject.

          Students who read with confidence take Introduction to Chemistry.
          Physical models are utilized to enhance studentâ€™s learning. As with
          other academic subjects, it is imperative students not only read but
          also comprehend the subject matter. Our teachers ensure students
          always explain technical concepts using proper scientific vocabulary.
          At this level we also begin teaching students to write about what they
          have learned using the scientific method. After chemistry, physics is
          introduced and then biology.
