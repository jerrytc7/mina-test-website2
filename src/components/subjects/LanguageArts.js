        <h4>Reading</h4>
        <p>
          Students are first introduced to letter sounds and phonics. Constant
          repetition using a variety of methods helps students develop a solid
          foundation. Children watch educational videos which makes learning
          attractive and fun. A variety of books are readily available and
          special time is set aside each day for students to enjoy hearing
          stories read out loud. Not only do we include fiction literature,
          books belonging to the non-fiction genre are also read to our
          students. This encourages curiosity and interest in science,
          geography, and history from childhood.
        </p>
        <h4>Writing</h4>
        <p>
          The first step to good handwriting is holding the pencil in the
          correct position. This vital skill is taught from the very beginning.
          We teach letter formation, accurate hand movements, and proper body
          posture. Each letter is carefully written multiple times. Continuous
          review guarantees our students become comfortable in scripting from an
          early age.
        </p>
        <h4>Grammar</h4>
        <p>
          The school follows the Voyages in English textbooks, as part of the
          curriculum. Students are taught the structure and conventions of the
          Modern English language with an emphasis on the basics. This includes
          the identification and understanding of nouns, pronouns, verbs,
          adverbs, adjectives, subjects, predicates, and other branches of
          grammatical conventions. Continuous review of previously taught
          concepts ensures that our students become extremely confident in their
          knowledge. Interactive activities make learning grammar an easy and
          interesting subject. We also teach students editing and proofreading
          for capitalization, sentence endings, usage of commas and apostrophes,
          and hyphens. A thorough understanding of sentence structure leads into
          sentence diagramming where students are taught the identification of
          sentence parts and the visual representation of such parts.
        </p>
        <h4>Root Vocabulary</h4>
        <p>
          Aiming to enhance student’s vocabulary range, word root vocabulary
          instruction is incorporated into the curriculum. We teach units on
          prefixes, suffixes, and word endings. Learning root words enables
          students to decipher meanings more easily, which leads to gradual
          vocabulary expansion. By understanding root words, children find it
          easier to decipher the meanings of more difficult words. Class
          discussions around the contextual usage of multifaceted words forms an
          important part of the curriculum. Teachers provide students with ample
          opportunities to show their full grasp of complex words.
        </p>
        <h4>Literature</h4>
        <p>
          We expose students to quality fiction and non-fiction literature.
          Emphasis on reading classical novels is one of the core foundations of
          our curriculum. Books are chosen carefully to ensure that the thematic
          elements in the stories revolve around good moral values. Students are
          taught how to read. We place importance on reading out loud with
          expression, stopping at periods, and pausing at commas. Students are
          encouraged to look up the meaning of difficult words. There is
          detailed instructional emphasis on inferential deductions and
          summarization, as well as author’s purpose and main ideas. In-depth
          discussions during literature circles encourages students to share
          their opinions and helps them to make connections with the characters
          and stories. This promotes a better understanding of the text. The
          culminating activity of novel studies is the production of book
          reports which showcase the student’s understanding of various story
          elements. On average, our students compile 3-4 major book reports per
          academic year.
        </p>
        <h4>Essay Composition</h4>
        <p>
          We teach essay writing using a comprehensive approach with an emphasis
          on good organization. We believe the first step in becoming a good
          writer is the ability to compose essays with organized structures.
          Students are taught how to accurately compose sentences, write
          attention grabbing introductions on their topic, detailed paragraphs
          in the middle, and conclusions which paraphrase the main ideas in the
          paper.
        </p>
        <h4>Handwriting & Typing</h4>
        <p>
          It is imperative for students to practice and use good handwriting.
          Not only does this make writing on paper easier and less tiresome, but
          students also derive benefits from this in mathematics. Our students’
          algebra work is more legible and, therefore, reduces the chance of
          making an error from misreading a number. In this age of technology,
          we also believe it is critical our students learn the essentials of
          computer keyboarding. Good posture and paying attention to typing
          movements may appear trivial but we believe learning to be mindful of
          such details has long-term benefits.
        </p>
        <h4>Spelling</h4>
        <p>
          We teach our students spelling strategies and patterns using
          phonetics. The children are encouraged to understand and think about
          how similar words use comparable letter arrangements. With constant
          review, children become excellent spellers who don’t learn word
          spellings through memorization, but by visualizing and sounding out
          letter sounds and recognizing patterns. This enable our students to
          read beyond the level typical for their age group and to enjoy reading
          good literature because it is within their grasp.
        </p>
        <h4>Speaking & Listening</h4>
        <p>
          We instruct our students in speaking and listening skills to ensure
          they can talk to groups, be understood, and also evolve into
          empathetic listeners. This important part of education is stressed
          during in-depth discussions in literature circles and their
          involvement in the junior level of the Toastmaster’s Gavel Club held
          regularly at the school. Our students learn to step out of their
          comfort zones and become confident when sharing their ideas and
          thoughts in front of an audience. We urge students to use good body
          language and powerful vocabulary words to make their points. Students
          learn how to frame the content of their speech in a cohesive manner
          and with positive reinforcement. They also practice extemporaneous
          speaking during the Toastmaster’s Gavel Club meetings when each
          student is assigned a topic and asked to speak on it without prior
          knowledge or preparation. These real-world skills are critical for
          students to master as they move into high school, college, and later
          the working world.
