          A physical fitness program will be a part of each student's agenda.
          Children have recess and time to play during the day. Exercise,
          nutrition and healthy development are emphasized.
        </p>
        <h4>Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
          Mina's Elementary School teaches children the importance of eating
          healthy foods instead of processed and "junk foods".
        </p>
        <h4>Yoga Class</h4>
        <p>
          Once each week, we have a yoga instructor visit our school to conduct
          a yoga class.
