        We follow an integrated approach to provide a conceptual framework for
        history, geography and civics. Oral presentations, research projects and
        field trips reinforce historical knowledge. The foundational requirement
        for any student learning history is to possess a strong reading ability.
        As soon as the student has a habit of reading and comprehending the
        material in an accurate manner, they begin receiving instruction in
        history. The textbooks which the school utilizes have been written by
        Joy Hakim, a venerable author who writes historical facts in a subtle
        fictional style. The content is multifaceted in that it not only
        presents data but also offers explanatory material to teach contextual
        associations among the facts. This helps students learn to identify
        significant facts from trivial ones. Our goal is to aid students in
        becoming proficient junior historians. After spending time at our school
        most pupils become experts at studying and self-sufficient learners. As
        a result of the continuous review and revise policy our students become
        confident and independent learners in every subject. A recent study,
        conducted by researchers Colin Macleod and Noah Forrin at the University
        of Waterloo and published in the journal Memory, found that reading
        words aloud made them easier to remember compared to silently reading
        them. We offer students an environment at our school where reading aloud
        is encouraged. The ideology behind our method of teaching employs the
        same principle: children will learn better if they are taught in an
        environment which provides an opportunity to read and share their
        understanding of information.
