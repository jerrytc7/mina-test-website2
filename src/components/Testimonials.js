              Since enrolling our son in Mina's Sci-Math school, we have been
              witnessing a miracle unfold before our eyes. Like most parents, we
              wished for our son to be inspired and to find value in his school
              work. Large classrooms and the "one size fits all" method of
              public education, was simply not working. As a result, we decided
              to seek an alternative. Immediately, it seemed everyone we queried
              offered RAVE reviews about Miss Mina. Shortly after, we decided to
              enroll our child. Miss Minaâ€™s teaching style along with her warm
              and nurturing spirit resulted in a transformation of our son's
              attitude toward all of his subjects including: reading, writing,
              math, science, history and more. His self-confidence continuous to
              escalate and he is motivated to complete his assignments from a
              position of inspiration. Miss Mina and her staff are terrific! Our
              only wish is that we had started with Miss Mina sooner!!

              This school is truly amazing! My son has attended for the last
              couple of years and has progressed in all respects, but especially
              in science and math. He now performs at a level in math more than
              two grade levels above where he would in public school. I have
              always believed in the philosophy of investing early and often; I
              am convinced that sending our son to Mina's school has been an
              investment that will benefit my son for his entire life. If you
              live near Great Falls and want to make a special investment in
              your child, you will be hard pressed to find anything better.

              My son attended Mina's Sci-Math Private School in Great Falls for
              two years. Prior to attending this school his organizational
              skills, grammar, mathematical concepts, reading comprehension, and
              science were all very weak. He has since made dramatic
              improvements in all of these areas. He can now organize his
              thoughts easily and process information in mathematics and other
              core subjects. Enrolling him in this private school has been the
              best investment that I made for his life, and I am so happy that
              my son is now prepared for future academic challenges.

              "The student to teacher ratio at Mina's Sci-Math Elementary,
              coupled with the teaching methods that are incorporated with the
              curriculum, are two of the many reasons why my nephew has started
              to love school and studying. Because he feels more confident and
              responsible now, he is beginning to make tremendous strides,
              especially in Mathematics & Organized writing. Mina's Sci-Math
              Elementary has been extremely effective and I vehemently recommend
              it to those who live in Great Falls, McLean, Vienna, Reston, and
              Herndon."

              "Our kindergartener has learned so much this year! The teachers
              give a personalized program for each child. Imagine an environment
              that helps a child learn in a caring, holistic environment. Our
              child loves going to school ! Since the fall, she has learned
              addition, reading, writing and she loves doing her "work" at home
              without being asked. Amazing system and teaching methods!"
