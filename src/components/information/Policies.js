        <h3>School Policies</h3>
      </header>
      <body>
        <h4>Non-Discrimination</h4>
        <p>
          Mina's School of Great Falls admits qualified students of any race,
          religion, national or ethnic origin, disability sex, or sexual
          orientation to all of the rights, privileges, programs, and activities
          generally accorded or made available to our private school students.
          We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or national and
          ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies,
          admissions policies, financial aid programs, or athletic and other
          school programs.
        </p>
        <h4>Allergies & Medications</h4>
        <p>
          Parents must notify the school of known existing allergies. Mina's
          School of Great Falls will also ask students to be sensitive to the
          allergies of other students to avoid exposure. To avoid allergic
          reactions in school, and deal with any that occur, other students and
          parents are notified that children have particular allergies and told
          which allergens to avoid sending to school. As required in Virginia,
          private schools may only administer medications by certified staff
          (those with MAT certification). Mina's Elementary School has staff
          that are MAT certified. Parents must provide the school with detailed
          parental consent forms, as supplied by the school (and Virginia's
          Dept. of Social Services), and instructions from the physician when
          required, and the medication to be administered.
        </p>
        <h4>Uniforms</h4>
        <p>
          Students should wear Navy Blue tops (shirt/blouse, etc.) and Khaki
          bottoms (pants/shorts/skirts, etc.). Clean, practical shoes of any
          type can be worn. Keep in mind that students will be allowed
          adult-supervised outdoor recess twice a day at the nearby soccer
          field, basketball court, or Great Falls Green and should be dressed
          appropriately.
        </p>
        <h3>Student Saftey</h3>
        <h4>Physical Building</h4>
        <p>
          Upon entering the school parents will find all exits are alarmed and
          equipped with modern video equipment. Students are not permitted to
          open doors during the school day. Only staff are allowed to admit
          visitors and students to the premises or release students after school
          or tutoring sessions. Students practice fire drills regularly to
          ensure they know what to do in an emergency. Students are monitored by
          staff members on school premises and also while on field trips.
        </p>
        <h4>Security Procedures & Review</h4>
        <p>
          We conduct an annual review of security procedures and retrain
          teachers and staff annually. At the beginning of each school year
          parents/guardians are asked to sign a form designating what adults are
          permitted to pick up their child/children. The student/s will be
          released only to adults on the list. Background checks are performed
          on all school staff.
        </p>
        <h4>Technology Policy</h4>
        <p>
          The school has a strict technology safety policy to ensure students
          view only appropriate Internet material when conducting academic
          research projects. Teachers monitor students who have permission to
          use the Internet.
        </p>
        <h4>Opt-Out Forms</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Form 1. Any parent or guardian who objects to his or her child’s

        <h4>Inclement Weather Policy</h4>
        <p>
          The school follows the same cancellation policy as the Fairfax County
          Public School system. You can click on the following web site for
          school delays, closing and early dismissal information.
          www.fcps.edu/alerts Due to the speed of updating, the official
          @FCPSnews Twitter account is generally the first and fastest mode of
          communication. In the case of emergency for a weather-related closing,
          delay, or early dismissal, the FCPS website will automatically include
          an alert at the top of each page with the appropriate information.
